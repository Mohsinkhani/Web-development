<p>The <b>chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> <time datetime="10-10-2000">july 7</time> is a domesticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a> <sup>23</sup>junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeast Asia. Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are layers.</p>
<p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.[9][10]

Other terms are:

Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[11][12]
Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
Chick: a young chicken[13]
Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)<sup><a href=somesource.com">[14]</a></sup>
Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[15]
Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[16]
Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[18]
Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[19]
Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[20] In fact, chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, chicken as a species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[21][page needed][failed verification]

<h2>
    Etymology
</h2>
<p>
    According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[22][23][24] and is widely used throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[25]

<h2>
    History
</h2>
<p>
    An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language (see Austronesian languages). Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were the domestic animals of the Lapita culture,[26] the first Neolithic culture of Oceania.[27]

    The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th century BC.[28][29]
    
    Chickens were spread by Polynesian seafarers and reached Easter Island in the 12th century AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans). They were housed in chicken coops built from stone, which was first reported as such to Linton Palmer in 1868, who also "expressed his doubts about this".[30]

<h2>
    Biology and habitat
</h2>
<p>
    Chickens are omnivores.[31] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[32] or sometimes young mice.[33]

    The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[34] The world's oldest known chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness World Records.[35]

    Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a pecking order, with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[citation needed]
    
    Chickens may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator. At least one credible report exists of a young fox killed by hens.[37][38][39] A group of hens have been recorded in attacking a hawk that had entered their coop.[40] If a chicken is threatened by predators, stress, or is sick, it may puff up its feathers.[41]

<h4>
    Vocalizations
</h4>
<p>
    When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.

A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.[42] However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.

Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.[43]

The long crowing of a Bergische Kräher

Normal length crowing (with audio). Long-crowing chickens have a longer crow.
Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.[citation needed]

Rooster crowing contests are a traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,[44] the United States, Indonesia and Japan. The oldest contests are held with longcrowers. Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain time is measured.
